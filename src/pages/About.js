        I grew up in the Chicago and its always been a tough place. From the
        gang activity to the drug epidemic and the big city bustle I escaped
        this world with comics books. I always wondered what it would be like to
        swing from the building of New York like Spider man does. Or what it
        would be like to create impossible inventions like Mr Fantastic. What
        does it feel like for wolverine to have those claws come out of his
        knuckles!!!??? Come and join me as I speak on all the comics books that
        helped me escape all the dangers of this world.
